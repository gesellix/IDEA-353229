Example project for the [IDEA-353229](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-353229/Compile-and-Reload-fails-with-Gradle) issue.

Gradle's configuration cache sometimes breaks IntelliJ's class reloading.

Demo: [IDEA-353229.mp4](IDEA-353229.mp4)

While this seems to be an IntelliJ issue, we also raised awareness at Gradle: [gradle/29087](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/29087).
